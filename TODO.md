# TODO

- [x] ~~Allow users to predict one by one or together?~~
  - [x] Store donor tensors in a dictionary indexed by target and check the dictionary before making predictions
- [x] Plot spectrum based on target -> every target has a spectrum plot now
- [x] Training and testing results visualization
  - [ ] More flexible plot features for users
- [x] Allow users to freely name the four axis names and data worksheet name and print_info() reflects this accordingly
- [ ] Show X_train, X_test, y_train as a printout in some dataframe

------

- [x] Give predictions even if failing subspace inclusion test

- [x] Pretty prediction results
- [x] Test find_donor_matrix()
- [x] Error handling
  - [ ] Hide traceback results in the middle
- [x] Print basic factual information about tensor -> print_info()
- [x] Show data in a pretty table format -> print_table()
- [x] Tensor() as an object
